# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React! This classic game allows two players to compete by taking turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.


## Features
### Real-time Gameplay: 
The game dynamically updates to display the current player's turn and announces the winner or a draw.
### Easy Reset: 
Start a new game anytime with the reset button, which resets the board and starts with Player X.


## Tech Stack
### React: 
The game is built using React for its powerful state management and component-based architecture.
