# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React! This classic game allows two players to compete by taking turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The game logic checks for a winner after every move by comparing the current state of the grid against predefined winning combinations. If a player manages to align three of their marks in a row, the game declares them the winner. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw. You can easily reset the game at any time using the reset button, which clears the grid and starts fresh with Player X.

## Features
### Real-time Gameplay: 
    The game dynamically updates to display the current player's turn and announces the winner or a draw.
### Easy Reset: 
    Start a new game anytime with the reset button, which resets the board and starts with Player X.

## Tech Stack
### React: 
    The game is built using React for its powerful state management and component-based architecture.
